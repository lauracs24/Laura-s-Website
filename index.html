  <h1>Why the Oculus Quest Should Not Have Been Bought by Facebook</h1>

<p>
The Oculus Quest is this really impressive virtual reality headset that aimed to transform gaming for everyone. But then Facebook acquired Oculus, and it sent a lot of fans into a bit of a panic. People started worrying that Facebook, which is notorious for collecting vast amounts of data and bombarding us with ads, might compromise our privacy. Nowadays, Facebook tracks everything from how we use our devices to our app interactions, and even our in-VR activities, like text input and voice commands. Plus, indie developers are concerned that a corporate giant like Facebook may prioritise profits over fostering creativity and innovation in the gaming community.
